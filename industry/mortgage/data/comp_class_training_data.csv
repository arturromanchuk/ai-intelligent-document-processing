City
West Stacie
State
VA
2647 Gerhold Tunnel, Hermistonberg, NV 39687-3934
Property Address
1. BORROWER'S PROMISE TO PAY
In return for a loan that I have received, I promise to pay U.S. $
375,000.00
(this
amount is called ""Principal""), plus interest, to the order of the Lender. The Lender is AnyCompany
Mortage Servicing LLC. I will make all payments under this Note in the form of cash, check or
money order. I understand that the Lender may transfer this Note. The Lender or anyone who
takes this Note by transfer and who is entitled to receive payments under this Note is called the
""Note Holder.'
2. INTEREST
Interest will be charged on unpaid principal until the full amount of Principal has been paid. I will
pay interest at a yearly rate of 2.87%.
The interest rate required by this Section 2 is the rate I will pay both before and after any default
described in Section 6(B) of this Note.
3. PAYMENTS
(A) Time and Place of Payments
I
will pay principal and interest by making a payment every month. I will make my monthly
payment on the 4th day of each month beginning on March 23rd 2020. I will make these payments
every month until I have paid all of the principal and interest and any other charges described
below that I may owe under this Note. Each monthly payment will be applied as of its scheduled
due date and will be applied to interest before Principal. If, on April 23rd, 2050, I still owe
amounts under this Note, I will pay those amounts in full on that date, which is called the
""Maturity Date."" I will make my monthly payments at or at a different place if required by the
Note Holder.
(B) Amount of Monthly Payments
My monthly payment will be in the amount of U.S. $2,721.23.
4. BORROWER'S RIGHT TO PREPAY
I
have the right to make payments of Principal at any time before they are due. A payment of
Principal only is known as a ""Prepayment.' When I make a Prepayment, I will tell the Note Holder
in writing that I am doing so. I may not designate a payment as a Prepayment if I have not made
all the monthly payments due under the Note. I may make a full Prepayment or partial
Prepayments without paying a Prepayment charge. The Note Holder will use my Prepayments to
reduce the amount of Principal that I owe under this Note. However, the Note Holder may apply
my Prepayment to the accrued and unpaid interest on the Prepayment amount, before applying
my Prepayment to reduce the Principal amount of the Note. If I make a partial Prepayment,
there will be no changes in the due date or in the amount of my monthly payment unless the
Note Holder agrees in writing to those changes.
5. LOAN CHARGES
If a law, which applies to this loan and which sets maximum loan charges, is finally interpreted so
that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with this loan
exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount
necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from me
which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me.
6. BORROWER'S FAILURE TO PAY AS REQUIRED(A) Late Charge for Overdue Payments
If the Note Holder has not received the full amount of any monthly payment by the end of
15 calendar days after the date it is due, I will pay a late charge to the Note Holder. The amount of
the charge will be 5% of my overdue payment of principal and interest. I will pay this late charge
promptly but only once on each late payment.
(B) Default
If I do not pay the full amount of each monthly payment on the date it is due, I will be in default.
(C) Notice of Default
If I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling me that if I do not pay the
overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may require me to pay immediately the full
amount of Principal which has not been paid and all the interest that I owe on that amount. That
date must be at least 30 days after the date on which the notice is mailed to me or delivered by
other means.
(D) No Waiver By Note Holder
Even if, at a time when I am in default, the Note Holder does not require me to pay immediately in
full as described above, the Note Holder will still have the right to do so if I am in default at a later
time.
(E) Payment of Note Holder's Costs and Expenses
If the Note Holder has required me to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note
Holder will have the right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing this
Note to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. Those expenses include, for example,
reasonable attorneys' fees.
7. GIVING OF NOTICES
Unless applicable law requires a different method, any notice that must be given to me under this
Note will be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to me at the Property Address
above or at a different address if I give the Note Holder a notice of my different address. Any
notice that must be given to the Note Holder under this Note will be given by delivering it or by
mailing it by first class mail to the Note Holder at the address stated in Section 3(A) above or at a
different address if I am given a notice of that different address.
8. OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS UNDER THIS NOTE
If more than one person signs this Note, each person is fully and personally obligated to keep all of
the promises made in this Note, including the promise to pay the full amount owed. Any person
who is a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note is also obligated to do these things. Any person
who takes over these obligations, including the obligations of a guarantor, surety or endorser of
this Note, is also obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note. The Note Holder may
enforce its rights under this Note against each person individually or against all of us together.
This means that any one of us may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this Note.
9. WAIVERS
I and any other person who has obligations under this Note waive the rights of Presentment and
Notice of Dishonor.
""Presentment"" means the right to require the Note Holder to demand payment of amounts due.
""Notice of Dishonor"" means the right to require the Note Holder to give notice to other persons
that amounts due have not been paid.
10. UNIFORM SECURED NOTE
This Note is a uniform instrument with limited variations in some jurisdictions. In addition to the
protections given to the Note Holder under this Note, a Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed
(the ""Security Instrument""), dated the same date as this Note, protects the Note Holder from
possible losses which might result if I do not keep the promises which I make in this Note. That
Security Instrument describes how and under what conditions I may be required to make
immediate payment in full of all amounts I owe under this Note. Some of those conditions are
described as follows:
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if
Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or
transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate
payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall
not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The
notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in
accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this
Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this
period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without
further notice or demand on Borrow.

Interest will be charged on unpaid principal until the full amount of Principal has been paid. I will
pay interest at a yearly rate of 2.87%.
The interest rate required by this Section 2 is the rate I will pay both before and after any default
described in Section 6(B) of this Note.
3. PAYMENTS
(A) Time and Place of Payments
I
will pay principal and interest by making a payment every month. I will make my monthly
payment on the 4th day of each month beginning on March 23rd 2020. I will make these payments
every month until I have paid all of the principal and interest and any other charges described
below that I may owe under this Note. Each monthly payment will be applied as of its scheduled
due date and will be applied to interest before Principal. If, on April 23rd, 2050, I still owe
amounts under this Note, I will pay those amounts in full on that date, which is called the
""Maturity Date."" I will make my monthly payments at or at a different place if required by the
Note Holder.
(B) Amount of Monthly Payments
My monthly payment will be in the amount of U.S. $2,721.23.
4. BORROWER'S RIGHT TO PREPAY
I
have the right to make payments of Principal at any time before they are due. A payment of
Principal only is known as a ""Prepayment.' When I make a Prepayment, I will tell the Note Holder
in writing that I am doing so. I may not designate a payment as a Prepayment if I have not made
all the monthly payments due under the Note. I may make a full Prepayment or partial
Prepayments without paying a Prepayment charge. The Note Holder will use my Prepayments to
reduce the amount of Principal that I owe under this Note. However, the Note Holder may apply
my Prepayment to the accrued and unpaid interest on the Prepayment amount, before applying
my Prepayment to reduce the Principal amount of the Note. If I make a partial Prepayment,
there will be no changes in the due date or in the amount of my monthly payment unless the
Note Holder agrees in writing to those changes.
5. LOAN CHARGES
If a law, which applies to this loan and which sets maximum loan charges, is finally interpreted so
that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with this loan
exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount
necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from me
which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me.
6. BORROWER'S FAILURE TO PAY AS REQUIRED(A) Late Charge for Overdue Payments
If the Note Holder has not received the full amount of any monthly payment by the end of
15 calendar days after the date it is due, I will pay a late charge to the Note Holder. The amount of
the charge will be 5% of my overdue payment of principal and interest. I will pay this late charge
promptly but only once on each late payment.
(B) Default
If I do not pay the full amount of each monthly payment on the date it is due, I will be in default.
(C) Notice of Default
If I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling me that if I do not pay the
overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may require me to pay immediately the full
amount of Principal which has not been paid and all the interest that I owe on that amount. That
date must be at least 30 days after the date on which the notice is mailed to me or delivered by
other means.
(D) No Waiver By Note Holder
Even if, at a time when I am in default, the Note Holder does not require me to pay immediately in
full as described above, the Note Holder will still have the right to do so if I am in default at a later
time.
(E) Payment of Note Holder's Costs and Expenses
If the Note Holder has required me to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note
Holder will have the right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing this
Note to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. Those expenses include, for example,
reasonable attorneys' fees.
7. GIVING OF NOTICES
Unless applicable law requires a different method, any notice that must be given to me under this
Note will be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to me at the Property Address
above or at a different address if I give the Note Holder a notice of my different address. Any
notice that must be given to the Note Holder under this Note will be given by delivering it or by
mailing it by first class mail to the Note Holder at the address stated in Section 3(A) above or at a
different address if I am given a notice of that different address.
8. OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS UNDER THIS NOTE
If more than one person signs this Note, each person is fully and personally obligated to keep all of
the promises made in this Note, including the promise to pay the full amount owed. Any person
who is a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note is also obligated to do these things. Any person
who takes over these obligations, including the obligations of a guarantor, surety or endorser of
this Note, is also obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note. The Note Holder may
enforce its rights under this Note against each person individually or against all of us together.
This means that any one of us may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this Note.
9. WAIVERS
I and any other person who has obligations under this Note waive the rights of Presentment and
Notice of Dishonor.
""Presentment"" means the right to require the Note Holder to demand payment of amounts due.
""Notice of Dishonor"" means the right to require the Note Holder to give notice to other persons
that amounts due have not been paid.
10. UNIFORM SECURED NOTE
This Note is a uniform instrument with limited variations in some jurisdictions. In addition to the
protections given to the Note Holder under this Note, a Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed
(the ""Security Instrument""), dated the same date as this Note, protects the Note Holder from
possible losses which might result if I do not keep the promises which I make in this Note. That
Security Instrument describes how and under what conditions I may be required to make
immediate payment in full of all amounts I owe under this Note. Some of those conditions are
described as follows:
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if
Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or
transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate
payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall
not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The
notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in
accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this
Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this
period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without
further notice or demand on Borrow.

pay interest at a yearly rate of 2.87%.
The interest rate required by this Section 2 is the rate I will pay both before and after any default
described in Section 6(B) of this Note.
3. PAYMENTS
(A) Time and Place of Payments
I
will pay principal and interest by making a payment every month. I will make my monthly
payment on the 4th day of each month beginning on March 23rd 2020. I will make these payments
every month until I have paid all of the principal and interest and any other charges described
below that I may owe under this Note. Each monthly payment will be applied as of its scheduled
due date and will be applied to interest before Principal. If, on April 23rd, 2050, I still owe
amounts under this Note, I will pay those amounts in full on that date, which is called the
""Maturity Date."" I will make my monthly payments at or at a different place if required by the
Note Holder.
(B) Amount of Monthly Payments
My monthly payment will be in the amount of U.S. $2,721.23.
4. BORROWER'S RIGHT TO PREPAY
I
have the right to make payments of Principal at any time before they are due. A payment of
Principal only is known as a ""Prepayment.' When I make a Prepayment, I will tell the Note Holder
in writing that I am doing so. I may not designate a payment as a Prepayment if I have not made
all the monthly payments due under the Note. I may make a full Prepayment or partial
Prepayments without paying a Prepayment charge. The Note Holder will use my Prepayments to
reduce the amount of Principal that I owe under this Note. However, the Note Holder may apply
my Prepayment to the accrued and unpaid interest on the Prepayment amount, before applying
my Prepayment to reduce the Principal amount of the Note. If I make a partial Prepayment,
there will be no changes in the due date or in the amount of my monthly payment unless the
Note Holder agrees in writing to those changes.
5. LOAN CHARGES
If a law, which applies to this loan and which sets maximum loan charges, is finally interpreted so
that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with this loan
exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount
necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from me
which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me.
6. BORROWER'S FAILURE TO PAY AS REQUIRED(A) Late Charge for Overdue Payments
If the Note Holder has not received the full amount of any monthly payment by the end of
15 calendar days after the date it is due, I will pay a late charge to the Note Holder. The amount of
the charge will be 5% of my overdue payment of principal and interest. I will pay this late charge
promptly but only once on each late payment.
(B) Default
If I do not pay the full amount of each monthly payment on the date it is due, I will be in default.
(C) Notice of Default
If I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling me that if I do not pay the
overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may require me to pay immediately the full
amount of Principal which has not been paid and all the interest that I owe on that amount. That
date must be at least 30 days after the date on which the notice is mailed to me or delivered by
other means.
(D) No Waiver By Note Holder
Even if, at a time when I am in default, the Note Holder does not require me to pay immediately in
full as described above, the Note Holder will still have the right to do so if I am in default at a later
time.
(E) Payment of Note Holder's Costs and Expenses
If the Note Holder has required me to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note
Holder will have the right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing this
Note to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. Those expenses include, for example,
reasonable attorneys' fees.
7. GIVING OF NOTICES
Unless applicable law requires a different method, any notice that must be given to me under this
Note will be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to me at the Property Address
above or at a different address if I give the Note Holder a notice of my different address. Any
notice that must be given to the Note Holder under this Note will be given by delivering it or by
mailing it by first class mail to the Note Holder at the address stated in Section 3(A) above or at a
different address if I am given a notice of that different address.
8. OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS UNDER THIS NOTE
If more than one person signs this Note, each person is fully and personally obligated to keep all of
the promises made in this Note, including the promise to pay the full amount owed. Any person
who is a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note is also obligated to do these things. Any person
who takes over these obligations, including the obligations of a guarantor, surety or endorser of
this Note, is also obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note. The Note Holder may
enforce its rights under this Note against each person individually or against all of us together.
This means that any one of us may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this Note.
9. WAIVERS
I and any other person who has obligations under this Note waive the rights of Presentment and
Notice of Dishonor.
""Presentment"" means the right to require the Note Holder to demand payment of amounts due.
""Notice of Dishonor"" means the right to require the Note Holder to give notice to other persons
that amounts due have not been paid.
10. UNIFORM SECURED NOTE
This Note is a uniform instrument with limited variations in some jurisdictions. In addition to the
protections given to the Note Holder under this Note, a Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed
(the ""Security Instrument""), dated the same date as this Note, protects the Note Holder from
possible losses which might result if I do not keep the promises which I make in this Note. That
Security Instrument describes how and under what conditions I may be required to make
immediate payment in full of all amounts I owe under this Note. Some of those conditions are
described as follows:
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if
Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or
transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate
payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall
not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The
notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in
accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this
Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this
period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without
further notice or demand on Borrow.

pay interest at a yearly rate of 2.87%.
The interest rate required by this Section 2 is the rate I will pay both before and after any default
described in Section 6(B) of this Note.
3. PAYMENTS
(A) Time and Place of Payments
I
will pay principal and interest by making a payment every month. I will make my monthly
payment on the 4th day of each month beginning on March 23rd 2020. I will make these payments
every month until I have paid all of the principal and interest and any other charges described
below that I may owe under this Note. Each monthly payment will be applied as of its scheduled
due date and will be applied to interest before Principal. If, on April 23rd, 2050, I still owe
amounts under this Note, I will pay those amounts in full on that date, which is called the
""Maturity Date."" I will make my monthly payments at or at a different place if required by the
Note Holder.
(B) Amount of Monthly Payments
My monthly payment will be in the amount of U.S. $2,721.23.
4. BORROWER'S RIGHT TO PREPAY
I
have the right to make payments of Principal at any time before they are due. A payment of
Principal only is known as a ""Prepayment.' When I make a Prepayment, I will tell the Note Holder
in writing that I am doing so. I may not designate a payment as a Prepayment if I have not made
all the monthly payments due under the Note. I may make a full Prepayment or partial
Prepayments without paying a Prepayment charge. The Note Holder will use my Prepayments to
reduce the amount of Principal that I owe under this Note. However, the Note Holder may apply
my Prepayment to the accrued and unpaid interest on the Prepayment amount, before applying
my Prepayment to reduce the Principal amount of the Note. If I make a partial Prepayment,
there will be no changes in the due date or in the amount of my monthly payment unless the
Note Holder agrees in writing to those changes.
5. LOAN CHARGES
If a law, which applies to this loan and which sets maximum loan charges, is finally interpreted so
that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with this loan
exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount
necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from me
which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me.
6. BORROWER'S FAILURE TO PAY AS REQUIRED(A) Late Charge for Overdue Payments
If the Note Holder has not received the full amount of any monthly payment by the end of
15 calendar days after the date it is due, I will pay a late charge to the Note Holder. The amount of
the charge will be 5% of my overdue payment of principal and interest. I will pay this late charge
promptly but only once on each late payment.
(B) Default
If I do not pay the full amount of each monthly payment on the date it is due, I will be in default.
(C) Notice of Default
If I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling me that if I do not pay the
overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may require me to pay immediately the full
amount of Principal which has not been paid and all the interest that I owe on that amount. That
date must be at least 30 days after the date on which the notice is mailed to me or delivered by
other means.
(D) No Waiver By Note Holder
Even if, at a time when I am in default, the Note Holder does not require me to pay immediately in
full as described above, the Note Holder will still have the right to do so if I am in default at a later
time.
(E) Payment of Note Holder's Costs and Expenses
If the Note Holder has required me to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note
Holder will have the right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing this
Note to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. Those expenses include, for example,
reasonable attorneys' fees.
7. GIVING OF NOTICES
Unless applicable law requires a different method, any notice that must be given to me under this
Note will be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to me at the Property Address
above or at a different address if I give the Note Holder a notice of my different address. Any
notice that must be given to the Note Holder under this Note will be given by delivering it or by
mailing it by first class mail to the Note Holder at the address stated in Section 3(A) above or at a
different address if I am given a notice of that different address.
8. OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS UNDER THIS NOTE
If more than one person signs this Note, each person is fully and personally obligated to keep all of
the promises made in this Note, including the promise to pay the full amount owed. Any person
who is a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note is also obligated to do these things. Any person
who takes over these obligations, including the obligations of a guarantor, surety or endorser of
this Note, is also obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note. The Note Holder may
enforce its rights under this Note against each person individually or against all of us together.
This means that any one of us may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this Note.
9. WAIVERS
I and any other person who has obligations under this Note waive the rights of Presentment and
Notice of Dishonor.
""Presentment"" means the right to require the Note Holder to demand payment of amounts due.
""Notice of Dishonor"" means the right to require the Note Holder to give notice to other persons
that amounts due have not been paid.
10. UNIFORM SECURED NOTE
This Note is a uniform instrument with limited variations in some jurisdictions. In addition to the
protections given to the Note Holder under this Note, a Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed
(the ""Security Instrument""), dated the same date as this Note, protects the Note Holder from
possible losses which might result if I do not keep the promises which I make in this Note. That
Security Instrument describes how and under what conditions I may be required to make
immediate payment in full of all amounts I owe under this Note. Some of those conditions are
described as follows:
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if
Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or
transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate
payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall
not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The
notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in
accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this
Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this
period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without
further notice or demand on Borrow.

pay interest at a yearly rate of 2.87%.
The interest rate required by this Section 2 is the rate I will pay both before and after any default
described in Section 6(B) of this Note.
3. PAYMENTS
(A) Time and Place of Payments
I
will pay principal and interest by making a payment every month. I will make my monthly
payment on the 4th day of each month beginning on March 23rd 2020. I will make these payments
every month until I have paid all of the principal and interest and any other charges described
below that I may owe under this Note. Each monthly payment will be applied as of its scheduled
due date and will be applied to interest before Principal. If, on April 23rd, 2050, I still owe
amounts under this Note, I will pay those amounts in full on that date, which is called the
""Maturity Date."" I will make my monthly payments at or at a different place if required by the
Note Holder.
(B) Amount of Monthly Payments
My monthly payment will be in the amount of U.S. $2,721.23.
4. BORROWER'S RIGHT TO PREPAY
I
have the right to make payments of Principal at any time before they are due. A payment of
Principal only is known as a ""Prepayment.' When I make a Prepayment, I will tell the Note Holder
in writing that I am doing so. I may not designate a payment as a Prepayment if I have not made
all the monthly payments due under the Note. I may make a full Prepayment or partial
Prepayments without paying a Prepayment charge. The Note Holder will use my Prepayments to
reduce the amount of Principal that I owe under this Note. However, the Note Holder may apply
my Prepayment to the accrued and unpaid interest on the Prepayment amount, before applying
my Prepayment to reduce the Principal amount of the Note. If I make a partial Prepayment,
there will be no changes in the due date or in the amount of my monthly payment unless the
Note Holder agrees in writing to those changes.
5. LOAN CHARGES
If a law, which applies to this loan and which sets maximum loan charges, is finally interpreted so
that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with this loan
exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount
necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from me
which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me.
6. BORROWER'S FAILURE TO PAY AS REQUIRED(A) Late Charge for Overdue Payments
If the Note Holder has not received the full amount of any monthly payment by the end of
15 calendar days after the date it is due, I will pay a late charge to the Note Holder. The amount of
the charge will be 5% of my overdue payment of principal and interest. I will pay this late charge
promptly but only once on each late payment.
(B) Default
If I do not pay the full amount of each monthly payment on the date it is due, I will be in default.
(C) Notice of Default
If I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling me that if I do not pay the
overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may require me to pay immediately the full
amount of Principal which has not been paid and all the interest that I owe on that amount. That
date must be at least 30 days after the date on which the notice is mailed to me or delivered by
other means.
(D) No Waiver By Note Holder
Even if, at a time when I am in default, the Note Holder does not require me to pay immediately in
full as described above, the Note Holder will still have the right to do so if I am in default at a later
time.
(E) Payment of Note Holder's Costs and Expenses
If the Note Holder has required me to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note
Holder will have the right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing this
Note to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. Those expenses include, for example,
reasonable attorneys' fees.
7. GIVING OF NOTICES
Unless applicable law requires a different method, any notice that must be given to me under this
Note will be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to me at the Property Address
above or at a different address if I give the Note Holder a notice of my different address. Any
notice that must be given to the Note Holder under this Note will be given by delivering it or by
mailing it by first class mail to the Note Holder at the address stated in Section 3(A) above or at a
different address if I am given a notice of that different address.
8. OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS UNDER THIS NOTE
If more than one person signs this Note, each person is fully and personally obligated to keep all of
the promises made in this Note, including the promise to pay the full amount owed. Any person
who is a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note is also obligated to do these things. Any person
who takes over these obligations, including the obligations of a guarantor, surety or endorser of
this Note, is also obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note. The Note Holder may
enforce its rights under this Note against each person individually or against all of us together.
This means that any one of us may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this Note.
9. WAIVERS
I and any other person who has obligations under this Note waive the rights of Presentment and
Notice of Dishonor.
""Presentment"" means the right to require the Note Holder to demand payment of amounts due.
""Notice of Dishonor"" means the right to require the Note Holder to give notice to other persons
that amounts due have not been paid.
10. UNIFORM SECURED NOTE
This Note is a uniform instrument with limited variations in some jurisdictions. In addition to the
protections given to the Note Holder under this Note, a Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed
(the ""Security Instrument""), dated the same date as this Note, protects the Note Holder from
possible losses which might result if I do not keep the promises which I make in this Note. That
Security Instrument describes how and under what conditions I may be required to make
immediate payment in full of all amounts I owe under this Note. Some of those conditions are
described as follows:
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if
Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or
transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate
payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall
not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The
notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in
accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this
Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this
period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without
further notice or demand on Borrow.

pay interest at a yearly rate of 2.87%.
The interest rate required by this Section 2 is the rate I will pay both before and after any default
described in Section 6(B) of this Note.
3. PAYMENTS
(A) Time and Place of Payments
I
will pay principal and interest by making a payment every month. I will make my monthly
payment on the 4th day of each month beginning on March 23rd 2020. I will make these payments
every month until I have paid all of the principal and interest and any other charges described
below that I may owe under this Note. Each monthly payment will be applied as of its scheduled
due date and will be applied to interest before Principal. If, on April 23rd, 2050, I still owe
amounts under this Note, I will pay those amounts in full on that date, which is called the
""Maturity Date."" I will make my monthly payments at or at a different place if required by the
Note Holder.
(B) Amount of Monthly Payments
My monthly payment will be in the amount of U.S. $2,721.23.
4. BORROWER'S RIGHT TO PREPAY
I
have the right to make payments of Principal at any time before they are due. A payment of
Principal only is known as a ""Prepayment.' When I make a Prepayment, I will tell the Note Holder
in writing that I am doing so. I may not designate a payment as a Prepayment if I have not made
all the monthly payments due under the Note. I may make a full Prepayment or partial
Prepayments without paying a Prepayment charge. The Note Holder will use my Prepayments to
reduce the amount of Principal that I owe under this Note. However, the Note Holder may apply
my Prepayment to the accrued and unpaid interest on the Prepayment amount, before applying
my Prepayment to reduce the Principal amount of the Note. If I make a partial Prepayment,
there will be no changes in the due date or in the amount of my monthly payment unless the
Note Holder agrees in writing to those changes.
5. LOAN CHARGES
If a law, which applies to this loan and which sets maximum loan charges, is finally interpreted so
that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with this loan
exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount
necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from me
which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me.
6. BORROWER'S FAILURE TO PAY AS REQUIRED(A) Late Charge for Overdue Payments
If the Note Holder has not received the full amount of any monthly payment by the end of
15 calendar days after the date it is due, I will pay a late charge to the Note Holder. The amount of
the charge will be 5% of my overdue payment of principal and interest. I will pay this late charge
promptly but only once on each late payment.
(B) Default
If I do not pay the full amount of each monthly payment on the date it is due, I will be in default.
(C) Notice of Default
If I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling me that if I do not pay the
overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may require me to pay immediately the full
amount of Principal which has not been paid and all the interest that I owe on that amount. That
date must be at least 30 days after the date on which the notice is mailed to me or delivered by
other means.
(D) No Waiver By Note Holder
Even if, at a time when I am in default, the Note Holder does not require me to pay immediately in
full as described above, the Note Holder will still have the right to do so if I am in default at a later
time.
(E) Payment of Note Holder's Costs and Expenses
If the Note Holder has required me to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note
Holder will have the right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing this
Note to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. Those expenses include, for example,
reasonable attorneys' fees.
7. GIVING OF NOTICES
Unless applicable law requires a different method, any notice that must be given to me under this
Note will be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to me at the Property Address
above or at a different address if I give the Note Holder a notice of my different address. Any
notice that must be given to the Note Holder under this Note will be given by delivering it or by
mailing it by first class mail to the Note Holder at the address stated in Section 3(A) above or at a
different address if I am given a notice of that different address.
8. OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS UNDER THIS NOTE
If more than one person signs this Note, each person is fully and personally obligated to keep all of
the promises made in this Note, including the promise to pay the full amount owed. Any person
who is a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note is also obligated to do these things. Any person
who takes over these obligations, including the obligations of a guarantor, surety or endorser of
this Note, is also obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note. The Note Holder may
enforce its rights under this Note against each person individually or against all of us together.
This means that any one of us may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this Note.
9. WAIVERS
I and any other person who has obligations under this Note waive the rights of Presentment and
Notice of Dishonor.
""Presentment"" means the right to require the Note Holder to demand payment of amounts due.
""Notice of Dishonor"" means the right to require the Note Holder to give notice to other persons
that amounts due have not been paid.
10. UNIFORM SECURED NOTE
This Note is a uniform instrument with limited variations in some jurisdictions. In addition to the
protections given to the Note Holder under this Note, a Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed
(the ""Security Instrument""), dated the same date as this Note, protects the Note Holder from
possible losses which might result if I do not keep the promises which I make in this Note. That
Security Instrument describes how and under what conditions I may be required to make
immediate payment in full of all amounts I owe under this Note. Some of those conditions are
described as follows:
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if
Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or
transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate
payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall
not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The
notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in
accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this
Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this
period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without
further notice or demand on Borrow.

The interest rate required by this Section 2 is the rate I will pay both before and after any default
described in Section 6(B) of this Note.
3. PAYMENTS
(A) Time and Place of Payments
I
will pay principal and interest by making a payment every month. I will make my monthly
payment on the 4th day of each month beginning on March 23rd 2020. I will make these payments
every month until I have paid all of the principal and interest and any other charges described
below that I may owe under this Note. Each monthly payment will be applied as of its scheduled
due date and will be applied to interest before Principal. If, on April 23rd, 2050, I still owe
amounts under this Note, I will pay those amounts in full on that date, which is called the
""Maturity Date."" I will make my monthly payments at or at a different place if required by the
Note Holder.
(B) Amount of Monthly Payments
My monthly payment will be in the amount of U.S. $2,721.23.
4. BORROWER'S RIGHT TO PREPAY
I
have the right to make payments of Principal at any time before they are due. A payment of
Principal only is known as a ""Prepayment.' When I make a Prepayment, I will tell the Note Holder
in writing that I am doing so. I may not designate a payment as a Prepayment if I have not made
all the monthly payments due under the Note. I may make a full Prepayment or partial
Prepayments without paying a Prepayment charge. The Note Holder will use my Prepayments to
reduce the amount of Principal that I owe under this Note. However, the Note Holder may apply
my Prepayment to the accrued and unpaid interest on the Prepayment amount, before applying
my Prepayment to reduce the Principal amount of the Note. If I make a partial Prepayment,
there will be no changes in the due date or in the amount of my monthly payment unless the
Note Holder agrees in writing to those changes.
5. LOAN CHARGES
If a law, which applies to this loan and which sets maximum loan charges, is finally interpreted so
that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with this loan
exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount
necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from me
which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me.
6. BORROWER'S FAILURE TO PAY AS REQUIRED(A) Late Charge for Overdue Payments
If the Note Holder has not received the full amount of any monthly payment by the end of
15 calendar days after the date it is due, I will pay a late charge to the Note Holder. The amount of
the charge will be 5% of my overdue payment of principal and interest. I will pay this late charge
promptly but only once on each late payment.
(B) Default
If I do not pay the full amount of each monthly payment on the date it is due, I will be in default.
(C) Notice of Default
If I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling me that if I do not pay the
overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may require me to pay immediately the full
amount of Principal which has not been paid and all the interest that I owe on that amount. That
date must be at least 30 days after the date on which the notice is mailed to me or delivered by
other means.
(D) No Waiver By Note Holder
Even if, at a time when I am in default, the Note Holder does not require me to pay immediately in
full as described above, the Note Holder will still have the right to do so if I am in default at a later
time.
(E) Payment of Note Holder's Costs and Expenses
If the Note Holder has required me to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note
Holder will have the right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing this
Note to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. Those expenses include, for example,
reasonable attorneys' fees.
7. GIVING OF NOTICES
Unless applicable law requires a different method, any notice that must be given to me under this
Note will be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to me at the Property Address
above or at a different address if I give the Note Holder a notice of my different address. Any
notice that must be given to the Note Holder under this Note will be given by delivering it or by
mailing it by first class mail to the Note Holder at the address stated in Section 3(A) above or at a
different address if I am given a notice of that different address.
8. OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS UNDER THIS NOTE
If more than one person signs this Note, each person is fully and personally obligated to keep all of
the promises made in this Note, including the promise to pay the full amount owed. Any person
who is a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note is also obligated to do these things. Any person
who takes over these obligations, including the obligations of a guarantor, surety or endorser of
this Note, is also obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note. The Note Holder may
enforce its rights under this Note against each person individually or against all of us together.
This means that any one of us may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this Note.
9. WAIVERS
I and any other person who has obligations under this Note waive the rights of Presentment and
Notice of Dishonor.
""Presentment"" means the right to require the Note Holder to demand payment of amounts due.
""Notice of Dishonor"" means the right to require the Note Holder to give notice to other persons
that amounts due have not been paid.
10. UNIFORM SECURED NOTE
This Note is a uniform instrument with limited variations in some jurisdictions. In addition to the
protections given to the Note Holder under this Note, a Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed
(the ""Security Instrument""), dated the same date as this Note, protects the Note Holder from
possible losses which might result if I do not keep the promises which I make in this Note. That
Security Instrument describes how and under what conditions I may be required to make
immediate payment in full of all amounts I owe under this Note. Some of those conditions are
described as follows:
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if
Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or
transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate
payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall
not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The
notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in
accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this
Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this
period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without
further notice or demand on Borrow.

The interest rate required by this Section 2 is the rate I will pay both before and after any default
described in Section 6(B) of this Note.
3. PAYMENTS
(A) Time and Place of Payments
I
will pay principal and interest by making a payment every month. I will make my monthly
payment on the 4th day of each month beginning on March 23rd 2020. I will make these payments
every month until I have paid all of the principal and interest and any other charges described
below that I may owe under this Note. Each monthly payment will be applied as of its scheduled
due date and will be applied to interest before Principal. If, on April 23rd, 2050, I still owe
amounts under this Note, I will pay those amounts in full on that date, which is called the
""Maturity Date."" I will make my monthly payments at or at a different place if required by the
Note Holder.
(B) Amount of Monthly Payments
My monthly payment will be in the amount of U.S. $2,721.23.
4. BORROWER'S RIGHT TO PREPAY
I
have the right to make payments of Principal at any time before they are due. A payment of
Principal only is known as a ""Prepayment.' When I make a Prepayment, I will tell the Note Holder
in writing that I am doing so. I may not designate a payment as a Prepayment if I have not made
all the monthly payments due under the Note. I may make a full Prepayment or partial
Prepayments without paying a Prepayment charge. The Note Holder will use my Prepayments to
reduce the amount of Principal that I owe under this Note. However, the Note Holder may apply
my Prepayment to the accrued and unpaid interest on the Prepayment amount, before applying
my Prepayment to reduce the Principal amount of the Note. If I make a partial Prepayment,
there will be no changes in the due date or in the amount of my monthly payment unless the
Note Holder agrees in writing to those changes.
5. LOAN CHARGES
If a law, which applies to this loan and which sets maximum loan charges, is finally interpreted so
that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with this loan
exceed the permitted limits, then: (a) any such loan charge shall be reduced by the amount
necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already collected from me
which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me.
6. BORROWER'S FAILURE TO PAY AS REQUIRED(A) Late Charge for Overdue Payments
If the Note Holder has not received the full amount of any monthly payment by the end of
15 calendar days after the date it is due, I will pay a late charge to the Note Holder. The amount of
the charge will be 5% of my overdue payment of principal and interest. I will pay this late charge
promptly but only once on each late payment.
(B) Default
If I do not pay the full amount of each monthly payment on the date it is due, I will be in default.
(C) Notice of Default
If I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling me that if I do not pay the
overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may require me to pay immediately the full
amount of Principal which has not been paid and all the interest that I owe on that amount. That
date must be at least 30 days after the date on which the notice is mailed to me or delivered by
other means.
(D) No Waiver By Note Holder
Even if, at a time when I am in default, the Note Holder does not require me to pay immediately in
full as described above, the Note Holder will still have the right to do so if I am in default at a later
time.
(E) Payment of Note Holder's Costs and Expenses
If the Note Holder has required me to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note
Holder will have the right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing this
Note to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. Those expenses include, for example,
reasonable attorneys' fees.
7. GIVING OF NOTICES
Unless applicable law requires a different method, any notice that must be given to me under this
Note will be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first class mail to me at the Property Address
above or at a different address if I give the Note Holder a notice of my different address. Any
notice that must be given to the Note Holder under this Note will be given by delivering it or by
mailing it by first class mail to the Note Holder at the address stated in Section 3(A) above or at a
different address if I am given a notice of that different address.
8. OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS UNDER THIS NOTE
If more than one person signs this Note, each person is fully and personally obligated to keep all of
the promises made in this Note, including the promise to pay the full amount owed. Any person
who is a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note is also obligated to do these things. Any person
who takes over these obligations, including the obligations of a guarantor, surety or endorser of
this Note, is also obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note. The Note Holder may
enforce its rights under this Note against each person individually or against all of us together.
This means that any one of us may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this Note.
9. WAIVERS
I and any other person who has obligations under this Note waive the rights of Presentment and
Notice of Dishonor.
""Presentment"" means the right to require the Note Holder to demand payment of amounts due.
""Notice of Dishonor"" means the right to require the Note Holder to give notice to other persons
that amounts due have not been paid.
10. UNIFORM SECURED NOTE
This Note is a uniform instrument with limited variations in some jurisdictions. In addition to the
protections given to the Note Holder under this Note, a Mortgage, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed
(the ""Security Instrument""), dated the same date as this Note, protects the Note Holder from
possible losses which might result if I do not keep the promises which I make in this Note. That
Security Instrument describes how and under what conditions I may be required to make
immediate payment in full of all amounts I owe under this Note. Some of those conditions are
described as follows:
If all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if
Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or
transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate
payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, this option shall
not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.
If Lender exercises this option, Lender shall give Borrower notice of acceleration. The
notice shall provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in
accordance with Section 15 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this
Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to the expiration of this
period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without
further notice or demand on Borrow.

state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.

This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender's assistance. Applicants should complete this form as ""Borrower"" or ""Co-Borrower"", as
applicable. Co-Borrower information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when

the income or assets of the Borrower's spouse or other person who has community
property rights pursuant to state law will not be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other person

state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.

This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender's assistance. Applicants should complete this form as ""Borrower"" or ""Co-Borrower"", as
applicable. Co-Borrower information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when

the income or assets of the Borrower's spouse or other person who has community
property rights pursuant to state law will not be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other person

state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.

This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender's assistance. Applicants should complete this form as ""Borrower"" or ""Co-Borrower"", as
applicable. Co-Borrower information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when

the income or assets of the Borrower's spouse or other person who has community
property rights pursuant to state law will not be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other person

state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.

This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender's assistance. Applicants should complete this form as ""Borrower"" or ""Co-Borrower"", as
applicable. Co-Borrower information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when

This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender's assistance. Applicants should complete this form as ""Borrower"" or ""Co-Borrower"", as
applicable. Co-Borrower information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when
the income or assets of a person other than the ""Borrower""

the income or assets of the Borrower's spouse or other person who has community
property rights pursuant to state law will not be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other person
has community property rights pursuant to applicable law and Borrower resides in a community property state, the security property is located in a community property
state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.

This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender's assistance. Applicants should complete this form as ""Borrower"" or ""Co-Borrower"", as
applicable. Co-Borrower information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when
the income or assets of a person other than the ""Borrower""
(including the Borrower's spouse) will be used as a basis for loan qualification or
the income or assets of the Borrower's spouse or other person who has community
property rights pursuant to state law will not be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other person
has community property rights pursuant to applicable law and Borrower resides in a community property state, the security property is located in a community property
state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.

This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender's assistance. Applicants should complete this form as ""Borrower"" or ""Co-Borrower"", as
applicable. Co-Borrower information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when
the income or assets of a person other than the ""Borrower""

the income or assets of the Borrower's spouse or other person who has community
property rights pursuant to state law will not be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other person
has community property rights pursuant to applicable law and Borrower resides in a community property state, the security property is located in a community property
state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.

This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender's assistance. Applicants should complete this form as ""Borrower"" or ""Co-Borrower"", as
applicable. Co-Borrower information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when
the income or assets of a person other than the ""Borrower""

the income or assets of the Borrower's spouse or other person who has community
property rights pursuant to state law will not be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other person
has community property rights pursuant to applicable law and Borrower resides in a community property state, the security property is located in a community property
state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.

This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the Lender's assistance. Applicants should complete this form as ""Borrower"" or ""Co-Borrower"", as
applicable. Co-Borrower information must also be provided (and the appropriate box checked) when
the income or assets of a person other than the ""Borrower""

the income or assets of the Borrower's spouse or other person who has community
property rights pursuant to state law will not be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be considered because the spouse or other person
has community property rights pursuant to applicable law and Borrower resides in a community property state, the security property is located in a community property
state, or the Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as a basis for repayment of the loan.
